Operating System(ROS) namely ROS nodes, topics, services, launches, pub-sub, and custom
messages. 

These tutorials are basically follow the tutorials that are available in the [ROS docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Tutorials.html). Also, this is an attempt to implement these basics in ROS2.

Here, [ROS2 Galactic](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/index.html) version is used.
