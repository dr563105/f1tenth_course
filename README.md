This repository contains my attempt at F1/10 [course](https://linklab-uva.github.io/autonomousracing/index.html) offered by the University of Virginia.
Though Prof. Madhur Behl offers this course in ROS1, I attempt to implement the ideas and
possibly simulate a race car in ROS2 Galactic. 

I will divide sections of this course in separate directories. 

1. [Intro](https://github.com/dr563105/f1tenth_course/tree/main/intro) has packages that
   explore the basics of ROS. 
2. More to follow...
